Odin Installed with:

    linux:
        https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/#others-unix
            built from source

        location:
        /usr/local/Odin

    windows:

        location:
        C:\Users\luciu\odin\odin.exe


Odin Usage:

    build with cmd "odin build <project root dir>"
    run with cmd "./<executable_name>"
        you can also run with cmd "odin run <project root dir>", which builds then runs, then deletes executable

Logging Util:

    Build:

        # NOTE: only use the below commands (faster compiling) for development. Use the commands in the build scripts for releasing production executables with performance optimizations turned on (and slower compiling).

        build c code (from project root dir):
            linux:
                gcc -c src/c/current_time_info.c -o src/c/build/current_time_info.o
                ar rcs src/c/current_time_info.a src/c/build/current_time_info.o
            windows:
                rmdir /s /q src\c\build
                cmake -S src\c -B src\c\build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang
                cmake --build src\c\build

                TODO: TO BE TESTED:
                    cl -TC -c src\c\current_time_info.c
                    lib -nologo src\c\current_time_info.obj -out:src\c\current_time_info.lib

        build odin code:
            # NOTE: building all files at once would require making them an odin collection cause each test/example has its own main function
            linux:
                odin build examples/readme_example.odin -file -out:build/readme_example
                odin build examples/full_example.odin -file -out:build/full_example
            windows:
                odin build examples/readme_example.odin -file -out:build/readme_example.exe
                odin build examples/full_example.odin -file -out:build/full_example.exe

    Run:
        linux:
            ./build/full_example # run from project root dir
            cd log; ./../build/readme_example # cd into log dir b/c readme_example creates log.txt in the current working directory the executable is run from
        windows:
            tbd

    To Do:

        test cross platform
            update linux build folder structure now that were using cmake on windows
                also test memory usage functions on linux, then use them in odin code, and delete memory_usage_*.odin
            create release windows build

        update readme
            finish readme example
        

    Backlog:

        maybe experiment with updating print() to take a struct PrintOptionalArgs
            and pass it to:
                print(),
                close(),
                init(),
                    and give init a verbose bool arg like close and say "Init log at <current_time>\n%s" log.filepath"
                    and call verbose_init in full_example.odin
                    and change close()'s verbose arg to verbose_close
                and the data given to Thread_Data in full_example.odin

            hopefully print() calls will look something like
                print("message", { .i=1, ... })
