Odin Installed with:
    https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/#others-unix
        built from source

    location:
    /usr/local/Odin


Usage:

    build with cmd "odin build <project root dir>"
    run with cmd "./<executable_name>"
        you can also run with cmd "odin run <project root dir>", which builds then runs, then deletes executable

Logging Util:

    Build:

        # NOTE: only use the below commands (faster compiling) for development. Use the commands in the build scripts for releasing production executables with performance optimizations turned on (and slower compiling).

        build c code (from project root dir):
            linux:
                gcc -c src/current_time_formatted.c -o src/current_time_formatted.o
                ar rcs src/current_time_formatted.a src/current_time_formatted.o
            windows:
                TODO: TO BE TESTED:
                    cl -TC -c current_time_formatted.c
                    lib -nologo current_time_formatted.obj -out:current_time_formatted.lib

        build odin code:
            # NOTE: building all files at once would require making them an odin collection cause each test/example has its own main function
            linux:
                odin build examples/readme_example.odin -file -out:build/readme_example
                odin build examples/full_example.odin -file -out:build/full_example
            windows:
                tbd

    Run:
        linux:
            ./build/full_example # run from project root dir
            cd log; ./../build/readme_example # cd into log dir b/c readme_example creates log.txt in the current working directory the executable is run from
        windows:
            tbd

    To Do:

        move odin code into src/odin/ and c code into src/c/

        create feature to display program start time start time
            string arg: "current datetime", "program duration"

            update the c function for this
                maybe update c logging util too?

            once this is done, update the thread safety test to use it instead of regualar time
                maybe reset log_init_time?
                log.init_time = // unix time

        finish example tests
            thread safety test

        test cross platform

    Backlog:

        maybe experiment with updating print() to take a struct PrintOptionalArgs
            and pass it to:
                print(),
                close(),
                init(),
                    and give init a verbose bool arg like close and say "Init log at <current_time>\n%s" log.filepath"
                    and call verbose_init in full_example.odin
                    and change close()'s verbose arg to verbose_close
                and the data given to Thread_Data in full_example.odin

            hopefully print() calls will look something like
                print("message", { .i=1, ... })
